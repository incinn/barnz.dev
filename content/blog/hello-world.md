Hello! Nice to meet you. My name is Barnz and I'm a web developer from the UK. I love **Linux**, ramen, and in my free time I still play the same [WWII FPS game](https://www.splashdamage.com/games/wolfenstein-enemy-territory/) I have since 2006. I enjoy mechanical keyboards and long walks on the beach.

Now that we know each other a little better, I want to talk about why I started a blog.

# Why a Blog?

I've always shied away from writing publicly. Mainly due to fears of writing something that I then learn is incorrect. This inevitably results in me not writing anything at all. I want to change that by documenting the things I learn here.

I will almost certainly make mistakes in the things that I post, so please forgive any inaccuracies you may come across. I will make a point of going back and updating any post that has incorrect information. Everything published here is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/incinn/barnz.dev) as a markdown file, so feel free to create an issue if you see something incorrect.

I'll mainly be writing about **Web Development** technologies, with a focus on the front end. I might even mention some interesting **Linux** tools or issues I come across too.

If any of that sounds interesting, consider subscribing to my [RSS](/blog/index.xml) feed to stay up to date.

If not, no hard feelings.
