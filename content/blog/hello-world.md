```js
console.log('Hello world!');
```

I am entirely new to blogging. Typically I don't like to write about things which I do not fully understand, which inevitably results in me not writing anything at all. I hope to change that: by learning more, and documenting what I learn here.

My vision for this blog is for it to be a place where I can consolidate my notes. Providing further information and insight (hopefully) on how I've solved specific problems and the issues I've faced along the way.

I expect to write about **HTML/CSS** and **JavaScript** mainly, as well as **web development** as a whole. I might document some cool **Linux** tools I come across too.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, consider consuming my [RSS](/blog/index.xml) feed, or join my [mailing list]().

If not, no hard feelings.

_Barnz_.
