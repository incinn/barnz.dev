Hello! Nice to meet you. My name is Barnz and I'm a web developer from the UK. I'm a massive Linux nerd, and have been playing the same [WWII FPS game](https://et.trackbase.net/server/etc) since 2006. I enjoy mechanical keyboards and long walks on the beach.

Now that we know each other a little better, I want to talk about the purpose of this blog.

# Why a Blog? 

I've always shied away from writing publicly. Mainly due to fears of writing something that I then learn to be incorrect. This inevitably results in me not writing anything at all. I hope to change that by documenting some of the things I learn here.

My vision for this blog is for it to be a place where I can consolidate my notes, and write up the things I am learning.

I am by no means an expert in anything that I'll be talking about, so please forgive any innacuracies you may come across. Everything published here is available on my GitHub as a markdown file, so feel free to create an issue if you see something wrong, pull requests are also welcome.

I'll be writing about **HTML**, **CSS/SASS** and **JavaScript/Typescript** mainly. I might also document some interesting **Linux** tools or issues I come across too.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, consider subscribing to my [RSS](/blog/index.xml) feed to stay up to date.

If not, no hard feelings.

_Barnz_.
