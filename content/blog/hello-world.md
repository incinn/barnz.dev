## Who am I?

Hello world! Nice to meet you. My name is Barnz, and I'm a web developer from the UK. I love **Linux**, ramen, and in my spare time I still play the same [WWII FPS game](https://www.splashdamage.com/games/wolfenstein-enemy-territory/) I've been playing since 2006. I enjoy mechanical keyboards and long walks on the beach - oh and I hate the colour yellow.

Now that we know each other a little better, I want to talk about why I started a blog.

## Why a blog?

I've always shied away from writing publicly. Mainly due to concerns of writing something that I later learn to be incorrect. This inevitably results in me not writing anything at all. I want to change that by documenting the things I learn here.

I will almost certainly make mistakes in the things that I post. I am constantly learning so please forgive any inaccuracies you may come across. I will make a point of going back and updating any post that has incorrect information.

Everything published on this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/incinn/barnz.dev) as a markdown file, so feel free to create an issue if you spot something incorrect. Or just drop me a message using the [contact form here]({{< ref "/contact" >}}).

## So, what content can I find here?

I'll mainly be writing about **Web Development**, with a focus on the front end. I might mention some **Linux** tools or issues I come across too. I'd like to experiment with some **hardware projects**, and plan to **self-host** some services in the future so I'm sure I'll write about those too.

If any of that sounds interesting, consider subscribing to my [RSS](/blog/index.xml) feed to stay up to date.

If not, no hard feelings.
