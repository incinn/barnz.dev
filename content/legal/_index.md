**TLDR**: I host an instance of [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), which is a [privacy respecting](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) open-source alternative to other big name Analytics tools. The source code for this website is also [open-source](https://github.com/incinn/barnz.dev), and has been released into the public domain. Written content is covered by a Creative Commons license, making it free to be used for any purpose (except commercial).

## Privacy Policy

I host an instance of Plausible Analytics which is used on this website. You can read detailed information on exactly [what information is collected here](https://plausible.io/data-policy). To opt-out, simply block the subdomain `admin.barnz.dev` which is serving the analytics script.

The only other information I have about your visit is from the webserver logs, which contain basic information about your visit such as your ip address and useragent. These logs are rotated often and not stored long-term.

Preferences you have chosen while using this website (such as using the accent colour picker, or enabling light mode) are stored in your browser's local storage and the data **never leaves your machine**. I have no way of knowing that #F733FF is your favourite colour.
