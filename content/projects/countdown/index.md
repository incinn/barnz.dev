A project to help me count down to important dates. Built with **TypeScript** and **SaSS**. 

I'm bad at remembering things, and even worse at counting down to them. This project outsources that task.

I needed something to help me count down to important dates. It needed to be aesthetic, shareable, and work on any device.

I decided against using any kind of frontend framework, as the scope of the project is fairly small. It was also a good exercise in using **TypeScript** outside of a framework.

The project currently only supports the hardcoded dates I've entered. This was fine to begin with, but I want to expand it to allow anybody to define a target date and share it. I'd also like to offer different types of display, for example how many seconds are remaining. This could be expanded into fun/pointless measurements like _how many cm your hair would grow_ in the time it takes to count down to zero.
